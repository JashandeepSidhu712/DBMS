# DBMS INTRODUCTION

## DATA

**Definition:** &nbsp; Data is a collection of raw, unorganized facts and details like text, observations, figures, symbols, and descriptions of things etc. In other words, data does not carry any specific purpose and has no significance by itself.  

**Characteristics:** &nbsp; Data is typically in its most basic form, lacking any context or interpretation. It consists of individual data points that may not have immediate significance on their own.  <br>

In a database, data is organized and stored in a structured manner, making it easier to manage, retrieve, and manipulate. 	<br>
Data is measured in terms of bits and bytes – which are basic units of information in the context of computer storage and processing. 	<br>
Data can be recorded and doesn’t have any meaning unless processed. <br>

**Example:** &nbsp; In a customer database, data could include individual entries with attributes like customer names, addresses, phone numbers, and purchase history. 

## INFORMATION

**Definition:** &nbsp; Information is the meaningful interpretation of data. It is derived from the data through analysis, processing, and organization, providing valuable insights or answers to specific questions. <br>

**Characteristics:** &nbsp; Information involves processing and transforming data to make it relevant, valuable, and useful for decision-making. It provides context and understanding to the data, enabling users to draw conclusions or take action. <br>

**Example:** &nbsp; Information derived from the customer database could include reports on customer demographics, purchasing patterns, and total revenue generated during a specific period. <br>


## TYPES OF DATA

### 1. Qualitative

**Definition:** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Qualitative data consists of non-numeric attributes or characteristics that describe qualities or categories.	<br>
**Representation:** &nbsp;&nbsp; It is descriptive in nature and cannot be measured on a numerical scale. <br> 
**Examples:** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Qualitative data includes attributes such as names, colors, gender, country of origin, product categories, etc.<Br>
**Data Type:** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Qualitative data is categorized as nominal or ordinal data in terms of its classification.	

Nominal data represents categories with no inherent order, while ordinal data represents categories with a meaningful ranking or order. 	<br>
Nominal data is used for classification purposes where items are placed into distinct groups. 	<br>
Ordinal data is used when there is a meaningful order, but the actual differences between categories may not be precisely measurable or consistent.

### 2. Quantitative

**Definition:** &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Quantitative data consists of numerical values that represent measurable quantities or variables. 	<br>
**Representation:** &nbsp; &nbsp; It can be measured on a numerical scale, allowing for mathematical operations and statistical analysis. 	<br>
**Examples:** &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Quantitative data includes attributes such as age, weight, temperature, number of items sold, income, etc. 	<br>
**Data Type:** &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Quantitative data can be further classified as discrete or continuous based on the nature of the values. 	<br>

Discrete data comprises distinct and separate values that are countable and typically represented by whole numbers. 	<br>
Continuous data comprises an infinite set of values within a range and is not limited to whole numbers, allowing for more precise and detailed measurements.

## DATABASE

In the context of Database Management Systems (DBMS), a database is a structured collection of data that is organized, stored, and managed in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, updating, and querying of information.

A database acts as a centralized repository to store large volumes of data, making it easier for users or applications to interact with the data in a structured and controlled manner.

## DATA WAREHOUSE

A Data Warehouse is a specialized type of database used in Database Management Systems (DBMS) that is designed to store and manage large volumes of historical and aggregated data from various sources within an organization. 

Its primary purpose is to support business intelligence (BI) and analytics activities, providing a consolidated view of data for decision-making and reporting.

## DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software application or system that facilitates the creation, organization, management, and manipulation of databases. 

It serves as an interface between users or applications and the underlying database, providing efficient and secure access to data. <br> The primary goal of a DBMS is to ensure data integrity, consistency, and efficiency in data storage and retrieval operations.
