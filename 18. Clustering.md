# CLUSTERING IN DBMS

The database clustering refers to a technique used to **improve the performance, availability, and scalability of a database system**. It involves **grouping multiple database servers together** into a **cluster**, which **functions as a single entity** to **serve client requests and manage data**.

## OBJECTIVES OF CLUSTERING

1. **High Availability**: Ensuring continuous access to the database even in the event of server failures.
2. **Load Balancing**: Distributing the workload across multiple servers to optimize performance.
3. **Scalability**: Allowing the database system to handle increasing data and user demands efficiently.
4. **Failover and Recovery**: Providing mechanisms for automatic failover and data recovery in case of failures or data loss.

## WORKING OF CLUSTERING

Clustering involves multiple computer systems working together as one entity, distributing user requests across nodes for load balancing, high availability, and fault tolerance. If one node fails, requests are handled by other nodes, ensuring uninterrupted service.
