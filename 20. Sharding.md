# SHARDING IN DBMS

Sharding in DBMS refers to a **database design and scaling technique** used to **horizontally partition a large database into smaller**, more manageable pieces called shards. Each shard is an independent database instance containing a subset of the data.

The primary goal of sharding is to **distribute the data and workload across multiple servers or nodes**, enabling **better load balancing** and **improving the overall performance and scalability** of the database. Sharding is commonly employed in large-scale applications and distributed databases, where a single server may not be sufficient to handle the high volume of data and traffic.

## ADVANTAGES OF SHARDING

Scalability & Performance
Distributed Workload
High Availability
Independent Management
Cost-Effectiveness

## DISADVANTAGES OF SHARDING

Complexity
Join Operations
Data Consistency
Query Routing
Initial Setup
