# ENTITY-RELATIONSHIP MODEL

The Entity-Relationship (ER) model is a conceptual data model used in database management systems (DBMS) to **represent the structure and relationships between entities in a database**.

The ER model is widely used in database design and serves as a basis for **converting conceptual data requirements into a logical database schema**. <br>
The ER model is typically visualized using ER diagrams, which are **graphical representations** of the entities, attributes, and relationships. 

The ER model aims to **represent real-world entities and their relationships in a database**. As such, the process of designing an ER model often involves close collaboration with domain experts to understand the semantics and constraints of the data being represented.

The ER model provides a **high-level representation of data requirements**. During database design, the **ER model is typically transformed into a logical schema**, such as the relational model, which uses tables, keys, and foreign keys **to represent entities and relationships** in a DBMS.

## ENTITY
Entities represent real-world objects or concepts that we want to store information about in the database.

Entities are the core building blocks of a database and are used to organize and classify data. Each entity corresponds to a table in the relational database model, where each row in the table represents a specific instance or occurrence of that entity.
